## ðŸ§© Project Overview

This project is part of our capstone course EE2421 and demonstrates practical understanding of embedded systems and UART-based bootloader communication.

We use the **original implementation** from the open-source project by [@niekiran](https://github.com/niekiran/BootloaderProjectSTM32) to:

- Upload firmware to STM32 via UART
- Erase and write to flash memory
- Handle read/write protection
- Send commands to STM32 bootloader from a Python script

## ðŸ“¦ Project Contents

This repository contains:

- `STM32_Programmer_V1.py`: Python script to interface with STM32 bootloader
- `user_app.bin`: Sample firmware for testing (provided separately)
- Reference link: [BootloaderProjectSTM32 by niekiran](https://github.com/niekiran/BootloaderProjectSTM32)
