## üß© Project Description

This project is a Python-based **host programmer tool** for STM32 bootloader communication, designed as part of a capstone project to demonstrate embedded systems integration and serial protocol handling. It is based on the open-source project by [@niekiran](https://github.com/niekiran/BootloaderProjectSTM32) and customized to fit our educational requirements.

The system enables a host PC to communicate with an STM32 board over UART, sending commands such as:

- Retrieve bootloader version and chip ID
- Flash memory erase (sector/mass)
- Memory write using `.bin` files
- Sector protection (read/write)
- Jump to application address

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- ‚úÖ Command-line interface for sending bootloader commands
- ‚úÖ UART serial communication using `pyserial`
- ‚úÖ CRC32 checksum validation
- ‚úÖ Flash memory control from PC
- ‚úÖ Clear status feedback and debug logs

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- STM32F4 MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE) with a custom bootloader
- USB-to-Serial connection (ST-LINK, USB UART, etc.)
- Firmware binary file (`user_app.bin`)
- Windows or Linux environment

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pyserial
